# Symbolic Math with Artificial inteligence : EDOs



## Resum

We present a user-friendly code for solving differential equations using artificial intelligence. 
The code is designed so that each person who executes it can insert the EDO he/she wants and the AI will obtain the solutions.


## Encoding  the equations : 

We introduce the equations in latex version and these will be passed to Polish notation, which writes a equation in the form of a tree. The neural network trained for this purpose will translate the ODE into a solution. 
 

## Test results : 

The creators tested the results against those offered by Wolfram Mathematica (the best software for solving ODEs) and this neural network IMPROVED THE RESULTS. Reaching to solve ODEs that Mathematica could not.
